# Vehicle-Rrouting-System-with-Genetic-Algorithm
Welcome to the Genetic Algorithm-Based Vehicle Routing System (VRS) Git repository! This project harnesses the power of genetic algorithms to tackle the complex challenges of optimizing routes for vehicles.This cutting-edge project combines the power of genetic algorithms with a tech stack featuring EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. 

## Overview
Our Genetic Algorithm-Based VRS is not just about optimizing routes; it's about revolutionizing the way we approach transportation logistics. By employing genetic algorithms, the system intelligently evolves and refines routes over time. The integration of EJS, CSS, and JavaScript ensures a dynamic and responsive user interface, while Node.js and Express.js power the server-side logic. MongoDB, a robust NoSQL database, provides efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Key Features
<ol>
  <li><strong>Genetic Algorithm Optimization</strong>: Utilize the power of genetic algorithms to continuously optimize vehicle routes.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Secure your VRS with user authentication, allowing only authorized personnel to access and manage route optimization.</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive Dashboard</strong>: Engage with a user-friendly and interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights into route optimization, fleet performance, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>EJS Templates</strong>: Leverage the simplicity and flexibility of EJS templates for dynamic HTML generation, ensuring a smooth user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Node.js and Express.js</strong>: Benefit from the speed and scalability of Node.js and the simplicity of Express.js for server-side development.</li>
  <li><strong>MongoDB Integration</strong>: Enjoy the advantages of MongoDB for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management, ensuring reliability and scalability.</li>
</ol>

## Prerequisites & Installation Instructions
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> git clone https://github.com/Kapoor-Tushar/Vehicle-Routing-System-with-Genetic-Algorithm.git</li>
  <li><strong>Installation of packages:</strong> First install node on your computer and then install all the dependencies present in package.json file. </li>
  <li><strong>Setting up Database(MongoDB):</strong> Create a account of mongoDB atlas, then create a cluster and then connect your cluste with the app by adding the connection string in the DATABASE field in config file.</li>
  <li><strong>Run the Application:</strong> After successful installation of packages and mongoDB set up run the server in VSCode with the help of the command nodemon server.js and then go to the local host at port number 7000 in your web browser.</li>
</ul>
